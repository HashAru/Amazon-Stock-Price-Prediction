# StockPredictor: Amazon Stock Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## Project Overview
StockPredictor is a machine learning project aimed at predicting Amazon's stock price using linear regression. The dataset consists of various commodity prices and trading volumes, such as Natural Gas, Crude Oil, Bitcoin, S&P 500, and more. The goal is to leverage historical market data to forecast Amazonâ€™s stock price based on these key features.

This project covers all aspects of the machine learning pipeline, including data exploration, feature engineering, model development, validation, and testing.


## Technologies Used

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:
- **Date**
- **Natural_Gas_Price**, **Natural_Gas_Vol.**
- **Crude_oil_Price**, **Crude_oil_Vol.**
- **Bitcoin_Price**, **Bitcoin_Vol.**
- **S&P_500_Price**, **Nasdaq_100_Price**, **Nasdaq_100_Vol.**
- **Apple_Price**, **Apple_Vol.**
- **Tesla_Price**, **Tesla_Vol.**
- **Microsoft_Price**, **Microsoft_Vol.**
- **Amazon_Price**, **Amazon_Vol.** (Target Variable)
- And many more.
  
## Methodology
### Data Preprocessing
Missing Values: Filled missing values with the mean of their respective columns.
Feature Scaling: Standardized the dataset using StandardScaler for uniformity across features.
Correlation Analysis: Conducted a correlation analysis using a matrix to determine feature importance and multicollinearity.
### Model Development
Linear Regression: Trained a linear regression model to predict Amazon's stock price.
Train-Test Split: Split the dataset into an 80-20 ratio for training and testing.
Metrics Used: Evaluated the model using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
### Model Validation
Cross-Validation: Performed 5-fold cross-validation to ensure model generalization.
Feature Importance: Analyzed the model's coefficients to assess the importance of each feature.
Results
The linear regression model performed with reasonable accuracy:

###### Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 5.094387862758271
###### Mean Squared Error (MSE): 42.55004809953231
###### Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 6.523039789816732


### Challenges Faced
-**Multicollinearity:** Highly correlated features, such as Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 prices, posed a challenge in model interpretability and performance.

-**Overfitting:** Cross-validation helped in preventing overfitting, ensuring the model performs well on unseen data.
